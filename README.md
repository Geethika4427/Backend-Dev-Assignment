# Instagram-X Integration

## Overview  
This project integrates Instagram with X.com (formerly Twitter) using Node.js. It fetches the latest post from the **BBC News Instagram account**, summarizes the caption using an **LLM**, and posts the summary as a tweet to an X.com account.

## System Architecture  
1. **Instagram Data Fetching:** Retrieves the latest post‚Äôs caption and image.  
2. **Caption Summarization:** Uses an LLM (Hugging Face) to generate a tweet-length summary.  
3. **X.com API Integration:** Posts the summarized text as a tweet.  
4. **Error Handling & Logging:** Handles API failures, rate limits, and logging.  
5. **Dockerization:** The project runs inside a Docker container for easy deployment.
